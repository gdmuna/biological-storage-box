# Backend context

`packages/backend` is TalosArk's NestJS API package. This document is the
local source of truth for its source layout; repository-wide routing lives in
the root `CONTEXT-MAP.md`.

## Boundary rules

- `bootstrap/` is the composition root. It assembles modules, global Nest
  infrastructure, and process startup; it contains no domain behaviour.
- `modules/` owns external adapters. HTTP controllers and HTTP DTOs live here.
  Ordinary business modules also own their use-case services and repositories
  under `internal/`.
- A module may consume another domain only through that domain's exported
  `*Kernel`; repositories are private implementation details. For example,
  Node and Share use `OrgKernel`, never `OrgRepository`.
- `core/` contains reusable platform/domain kernels with a deliberately small
  public interface. Its `internal/` directory is not an application-wide API.
- `platform/` adapts transport concerns such as HTTP guards, request context,
  exception mapping, and observability. Shared security/authorization logic
  belongs in a kernel; an HTTP guard is only its HTTP wrapper.
- `infra/` implements concrete technical integrations. Do not introduce a
  port/adapter seam until there is a real second implementation to support.
- `shared/` is for framework-independent utilities only. It must not import
  Nest modules, HTTP objects, or domain modules.

## Current implementation notes

- Identity currently supports local password accounts plus stateless JWT access
  and refresh tokens. The Casdoor file is a TODO for a future platform-level
  OIDC broker, not organization-specific IdP configuration.
- File relation definitions remain code-owned domain rules. The registry is a
  TODO placeholder rather than a database configuration table.
- Controllers remain concentrated in `modules/`, including wrappers for core
  capabilities (`auth`, `file`). Future WebSocket/SSE handlers belong
  in their owning module as transport adapters, while shared behavior stays in
  the corresponding kernel.
